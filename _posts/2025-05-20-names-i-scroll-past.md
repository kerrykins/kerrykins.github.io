It never stops surprising me just how easy it is for people to vanish from your life. I’m not talking about anything explosive or dramatic, but the kind of silence that slowly creeps in unnoticed. One day, you realise that it’s been months since you last spoke, and neither of you seems to be reaching anymore. 

There was no fallout. No big event. No final conversation where things are laid bare. It’s just the slow unravelling of something that once felt so woven in until all you’re left with is a faint sense of absence and a memory of what used to be constant. 

I think about them sometimes – not always, but enough. It happens on those quiet nights. Or those moments when a shared joke resurfaces in my mind. Or when I come across something they would’ve loved. And in those moments, it feels almost absurd how far away they are now. The space between now and the last time we actually knew each other has quietly become an abyss. 

A quote from the show “How I Met Your Mother” stuck with me for years, and it’s one I first heard long before I understood how true it was. Some of the jokes in HIMYM haven’t aged well, but the life lessons have. It goes like this:

> As you grow up, you will be shocked when you discover how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever. That’s why, when you find someone you want to keep around, you do something about it.

Every time that quote flashes in my head, something in me flinches. I’ve done the parting. I’ve also been parted with. 

Some of those losses were mutual. It’s when two people silently agree to drift. Others are more lopsided: one of us holding on just a bit longer than the other. We wait for a message that never came, or perhaps we never sent one. I’ve seen both versions. I’ve left, and I’ve been left. Neither feels clean. 

Don’t get me wrong though, I’m not saying that a final moment to wrap things up neatly is owed to us. Or expected. That’s not a bad thing. Life isn’t always built for tidy conclusions – sometimes people fade, without intent or harm, and that has to be enough. 

And you know what? It’s not always because of love or conflict. Sometimes it’s timing, inertia, or change. Or the quiet yet heavy fatigue of people growing in different directions and not knowing how to bring their old selves into something new. 

Even knowing all that though – *even* when I hold that logic close – there are names I scroll past, photos from the past, and conversations I sometimes replay in my head that make me pause. I wonder, sometimes, if they think of me too – a gentle unspoken, “Oh, you were important once.” 

That kind of memory doesn’t sting, but it lingers. It teaches. It reminds me that connections aren’t guaranteed, and that staying in someone’s life - *really* staying – takes more than intention. It takes movement. 

At the end of the day, the normalcy of drifting connections is one of those quiet heartbreaks that no one really prepares you for. That’s why, when someone matters, when a connection feels worth preserving, you make time. Meaningful connections require tending and without it, even the strongest bonds quietly stretch into distance. Eventually, that distance becomes space.
