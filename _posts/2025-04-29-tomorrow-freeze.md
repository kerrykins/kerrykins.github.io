*“You’re lazy. Try harder.”* 

It doesn’t yell. It doesn’t have to. It’s said with a reverberating familiarity.

It usually starts like that. \
Sharp. Unforgiving. \
The panic, disguised as urgency, usually rushes in soon after.

*“Get up. Fix it. Now.”*

But the second you move, it shifts. 

*“Not like that. Not yet. It’s not good enough.”* 

Except you want to do better. \
So you tell yourself, *“Do the thing, let’s do what we know helps. Just do it.”* 

But when you reach for it, anxiety grinds its gears. \
It becomes too loud to think. \
It short circuits everything you had planned. 

Suddenly, everything you know – everything that’s supposed to help – feels sharp. \
Dangerous.

These are the moments when you know exactly what would help. \
But still, you don’t move. \
It’s not confusion. Nor is it avoidance. 

The mind says, *“Do it.”* \
The body says, *“Don’t you dare.”* 

And you freeze. 

You freeze in front of a stairwell you’ve seen a hundred times. \
You’ve mapped it out. You know where it goes. 

But between you and the first step, there’s a solid wall of ice. \
It’s built from years of fear, avoidance, exhaustion, and depression.

Some days, you chip at it. You make cracks. \
You are rewarded with the familiar tendrils of warmth pushing through. \
You tell yourself, *“Tomorrow.”* 

But by morning, the wall glints mercilessly at you, as if yesterday never happened. \

Some days, the ice does give way.
But when you first touch the stair, the whole thing shifts ever so slightly. \
It’s like the air shifts - like the body's bracing for the impact that never comes.

*“Don’t climb it. DANGER. Don’t try it. DANGER. Don’t risk it.”*

And you don’t. \
Not because you know it’s dangerous - but because it feels like it is. \
Because falling again would hurt too much.

Or so you tell yourself.  

Day after day, you stay behind the ice. \
You tell yourself that you’ll try again tomorrow.

But tomorrow comes with its own freeze.

You begin to chip all over again.

Except it's not a literal wall of ice. And you're not not holding a pickaxe. \
But in a room, on a couch buried under a heavy mess of blankets, with a cup of coffee you meant to drink hours ago. \
With unread emails, with unopened tabs, and with one thing - just the one - you know you need to do. 

You know what would help. \
You do.

You really do.
