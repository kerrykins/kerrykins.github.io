To Whom It May Inconveniently Concern,

Thank you for your recent application for forgiveness.

We understand this request was submitted under considerable social pressure, likely encouraged by the uncomfortably long silence, mutual friends, or the person who advised you to “just reach out.”

After careful review – a review for which we were never compensated – we regret to inform you that your request has been denied.

While we appreciate your commitment to performative remorse, we were unable to verify your sincerity in the surface-level phrasing or the enthusiastic use of non-apology apologies. Unfortunately, citing ‘personal growth’ without any observable change is mindfulness-flavoured nonsense.

Furthermore, framing your actions as a misunderstanding, despite clear evidence and that awful silence you pretend not to notice, did not strengthen your case.

We also note your follow-up messages of “are we good now?” and “can we move past this?” were sent less than 24 hours after your apology. It appears that you’ve confused the concept of ‘closure’ with a scripted, time-sensitive exchange of pleasantries in which we quietly absorb the consequences of your actions.

Per Article 14 of the Emotional Labour Handbook, forgiveness is not a vending machine you kick when it doesn’t dispense closure.

It also is not a panic button you press when accountability becomes uncomfortable.

It is definitely not owed to you.

Should you wish to reapply in the future, please include: an actual apology, proof that you understand that repair is an ongoing process, and some awareness that closure isn’t something to be extracted but earned.

Please note that this office does not provide catharsis on demand.

Thank you for your interest in emotional maturity.

Best regards,
The Department of I’m Still Processing It
