*“You’re lazy. Try harder.”* 

It doesn’t yell. It doesn’t have to. It’s said with a reverberating familiarity. 

It usually starts like that. 
Sharp. Unforgiving. 
The panic, disguised as urgency, usually rushes in soon after. 

*“Get up. Fix it. Now.”*

But the second I move, it shifts. 

*“Not like that. Not yet. It’s not good enough.”* 

Except I want to do better. 
So I tell myself, *“Do the thing, let’s do what we know helps. Just do it.”* 

But when I reach for it, the volume spikes. 
Anxiety lets out a bloodcurdling scream. 
It echoes deafeningly in my skull.

Suddenly, everything I know – everything that’s supposed to help – feels sharp. 
Dangerous. 

These are the moments when I know exactly what would help. 
But still, I don’t move. 
It’s not confusion. Nor is it avoidance. 

The mind says, *“Do it.”* 
The body says, *“Don’t you dare.”* 

And you freeze. 

You freeze in front of a stairwell you’ve seen a hundred times. 
You’ve mapped it out. You know where it goes. 

But between you and the first step, there’s a solid wall of ice. 
It’s built from years of fear, avoidance, exhaustion, and depression.  

Some days, you chip at it. You make cracks. 
You are rewarded with the familiar tendrils of warmth pushing through. 
You tell yourself, *“Tomorrow.”* 

But by morning, the wall glints mercilessly at you, and the cracks of yesterday have vanished without a trace. 

Some days, the ice does give way. 
But when you first touch the stair, the whole thing shifts ever so slightly. 
It’s enough to make your stomach drop. 
Warning bells begin blaring in your head. 

*“Don’t climb it. DANGER. Don’t try it. DANGER. Don’t risk it.”*

And you don’t. 
Because falling again would hurt too much. 

Or so you tell yourself.  

Day after day, you stay behind the ice. 
You tell yourself that you’ll try again tomorrow. 

But with tomorrow comes with its own freeze. 

You begin to chip all over again. 

You know what would help. 
You do. 

You really do.
