If someone told me a decade ago that I would find my queer awakening in World of Warcraft, I would’ve laughed at the absurdity of it. If someone told me I would one day be a guild master, I would’ve definitely scoffed at how ridiculous that sounded. 

Being a guild master is less like captaining a grand ship across open seas and more like captaining a rowboat made of soggy cardboard. It was a crew where half of them argued about loot, and the other accidentally jumped overboard. Somehow, I loved it still – at least for a while. 

In late 2022, I joined a queer guild. At the time, I was closeted, crumbling, and unsure where I belonged. At the same time, I was slowly losing a quiet, private war with my mind. Somehow this guild and its oddball band of gaymers and gremlins gave me something I hadn’t had in a long time: a place to be, to try, and to matter. Through it, I got to explore my queerness. I got to build friendships. 

Then I became guild master. 

I believed that I could build something that could outlast me. For a while, it worked. We ran raids. We survived ‘guild killer’ events. We juggled spreadsheets. We sighed – together – in exasperation when signups didn’t work out. We dealt with loot drama. I learned to lead in voice and silence. I made mistakes, and still, made things happen. Events and connections felt, at the time, like magic. 

But seasons change; the tavern I once stumbled into became unfamiliar. 

As we faced down the barrel of a new expansion, the community shifted. Or perhaps it had already shifted before I noticed. The people I started this journey with began to drift. Those connections began to fray. Unfortunately, some of those relationships were lost to tension and fatigue. Mind you, I was not without fault; there are many things that I would have done differently. But the pressure was on, and exhaustion had taken its toll. In those moments, it was hard to see clearly, and even harder to act perfectly. 

The truth is, I think my departure was quietly welcomed. It wasn’t because I was disliked – at least not by most - but because the guild already moved beyond me. It had grown into something I didn’t quite understand. I had grown into someone it no longer needed. Perhaps my approach became alienating. Perhaps *I* had become alienating. It’s hard to say. What was certain were two things: I was burnt out, and they were ready to move on. 

I remain slightly bitter to this day. It isn’t a spiteful bitterness, mind you, but a tender and aching way you’d feel when something mattered a lot, and then changed without you. The way I said goodbye didn’t help either; it didn’t honour the relationships I had made. When I stepped down, I was hurt by what felt like fraying connections and silence where closeness once lived. I didn’t reach out gently, nor offer soft farewells. I left on the terms of my disappointment, shaped by the belief that the people I had grown fond of no longer needed me. 

The silence that followed hurt. It was, in many ways, a silence I helped create. 

The goodbyes I didn’t get from the people I thought would reach out left a mark. In another version of things, I would’ve done things differently. I would have left with more grace and openness. Exhaustion speaks loudly, and at the time, I was too worn down to part ways kindly. 

But bitterness doesn’t erase beauty.

For nearly two years, I served as guild master. That span of time holds weight. It was a time of joyful chaos. It was a time where people felt safe enough to be themselves. Even if most of it faded, or evolved into something else, it happened. And because it happened, it matters. 

I wish my former guildmates the very best. I hope the guild continues to grow and thrive in ways I couldn’t have imagined. And I hope quietly and sincerely that I added something positive to their lives during the time we shared.

I’ve long since logged out. The title is gone and burden set down. But I carry it with me: the lessons, the failures, the small moments of connection that shimmered like a campfire in Icecrown. 

Maybe, just maybe, that’s enough.
