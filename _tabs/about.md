> "It’s not a cry for help; it’s a well-punctuated whisper."

Hey yo!

If you’ve made it to this very niche outpost of the internet, I can only assume fate, chaos, or the algorithm brought you here. I’ll do my best to make the detour worth it.

I'm a recovering overachiever, part-time ghost, and full-time feeler of too many feelings. I like to write things - sometimes they’re personal essays. Other times? They’re just elaborate excuses for emotional excavations.

I have a sociology brain plus a side (bad) habit of making eye contact with my trauma. I used to write purely for academia. As of April 2025, I joined a little workshop to explore some creative writing. So naturally, now I want to add a little creative flair to my writing regimen. Super sorry for all the stuff I wrote before April 2025 8). Many posts are first debuted on another site before being published onto my own blog. 

This is where I make sense of the world, myself, and all the awkward queer little in-betweens of both.

Come for the reflections. Stay for the existential puns 8).
