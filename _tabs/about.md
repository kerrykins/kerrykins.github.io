> "It’s not a cry for help; it’s a well-punctuated whisper."

Hey yo!

I’m Kerry! I'm a recovering overachiever, part-time ghost, and full-time feeler of too many feelings. I like to write things - sometimes they’re personal essays. Other times? They’re just elaborate excuses for emotional excavations.

I have a sociology brain plus a side (bad) habit of making eye contact with my trauma. I used to write purely for academia. Now I want to add a little creative flair to my writing regimen. I hope you stay for a little bit!

This is where I make sense of the world, myself, and all the awkward queer little in-betweens of both.

Come for the reflections. Stay for the existential puns 8).
